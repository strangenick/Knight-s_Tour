# Knight-s_Tour

This program solves the Knight's Tour problem using Warnsdorff's heuristic for the first 32 moves and an exhaustive approach for the remainder. The user can create a list of starting positions for the knight, and the program will solve the Knight's Tour for each of those starting positions.
